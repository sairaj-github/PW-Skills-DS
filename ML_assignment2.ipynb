    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, and as a result, it performs poorly on new data. This is because the model has memorized the training data, including the noise and outliers, and as a result, it is not able to generalize well to new data.\n",
    "- Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model does not learn the training data well enough, and as a result, it performs poorly on both training and new data. This is because the model is not complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to mitigate overfitting and underfitting. Some of these methods include:\n",
    "1. Data preprocessing: This involves cleaning the data and removing noise and outliers.\n",
    "2. Model selection: This involves choosing a model that is not too complex and not too simple.\n",
    "3. Regularization: This involves adding constraints to the model to prevent it from overfitting.\n",
    "4. Cross-validation: This involves splitting the data into training and test sets, and then training the model on the training set and evaluating it on the test set. This helps to identify whether the model is overfitting or underfitting."

    "- Model selection: This involves choosing a model that is not too complex and not too simple. A model that is too complex is more likely to overfit, while a model that is too simple is more likely to underfit.\n",
    "- Regularization: This involves adding constraints to the model to prevent it from overfitting. Regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization add penalty terms to the model's objective function, which helps to reduce the model's complexity and prevent it from overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Bias is the difference between the expected value of a model's predictions and the true value of the target variable. A model with high bias is likely to make systematic errors, such as consistently underestimating or overestimating the target variable.\n",
    "- Variance is the amount of variation in a model's predictions. A model with high variance is likely to make unpredictable errors, such as sometimes underestimating and sometimes overestimating the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental trade-off in machine learning. As a model's complexity increases, its bias decreases and its variance increases. This is because a more complex model is able to fit the training data more closely, but it is also more likely to overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal model is one that has low bias and low variance. However, in practice, it is often necessary to make a trade-off between these two factors. A model with low bias may have high variance, and a model with low variance may have high bias."

    "\n",
    "- Training and test error: The training error is the error of the model on the training data. The test error is the error of the model on new data. If the test error is much higher than the training error, then the model is likely to be overfitting.\n",
    "- Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating the performance of a model on new data. It involves splitting the data into a number of folds, and then training the model on a subset of the data and evaluating it on the remaining folds. If the model performs well on all of the folds, then it is less likely to be overfitting.\n",
    "- Feature importance: Feature importance is a measure of how important each feature is to the model. If a model is overfitting, then the feature importance scores will be concentrated on a small number of features.\n",
    "- Learning curves: Learning curves plot the error of the model as a function of the number of training examples. If the learning curves start to plateau or increase after a certain number of training examples, then the model is likely to be overfitting.\n",
